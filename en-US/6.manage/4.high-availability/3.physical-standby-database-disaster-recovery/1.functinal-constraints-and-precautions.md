# Overview of Physical Standby Database

Physical Standby Database is an important part of the high availability solution of OceanBase Database. If the primary database becomes unavailable, for example, the majority of replicas fail, a standby database takes over the services. Lossless switchover with a recovery point objective (RPO) of 0 and lossy switchover with an RPO greater than 0 are supported to minimize the service downtime.

Physical Standby Database is equivalent to the primary/standby cluster deployment mode in OceanBase Database earlier than V4.1.0. All user tenants in the primary cluster are primary tenants, and all user tenants in a standby cluster are standby tenants. Modifications of primary tenants are automatically synchronized to standby clusters.

Since OceanBase Database V4.1.0, Physical Standby Database is implemented in the form of primary and standby tenants, and clusters are only containers of tenants. User tenants are categorized into primary tenants and standby tenants. A primary tenant is a business tenant created by a user and supports all database service capabilities, such as query, DML operations, and DDL operations. A standby tenant provides only disaster recovery capabilities and read-only services. A Physical Standby Database high-availability solution consists of a primary tenant and multiple standby tenants.

Features of Physical Standby Database of OceanBase Database V4.1.0:

* The primary tenant and its standby tenants can be deployed in the same cluster or in different clusters, depending on the required level of disaster recovery.

* The primary and standby tenants are separately deployed. You need to create log synchronization links between the primary and standby tenants. OceanBase Database V4.1.0 supports only log synchronization based on log archiving.

* Physical Standby Database supports only the maximum performance mode. The maximum protection mode and maximum availability mode are no longer supported.
