# Privilege delegation

Privilege delegation solves the problem due to the centralization of privileges to a limited number of authorizers. When you grant a privilege to a user by using a `WITH ADMIN OPTION` or `WITH GRANT OPTION` clause in the `GRANT` statement, you allow the user to grant the same privilege to other users. The revocation of object privileges extends to dependent users. For example, when you revoke an object privilege from User A who has delegated the object privilege to User B, the object privilege is also revoked from User B. The revocation of system privileges does not extend to dependent users. 

## Examples

1. Log on to an Oracle tenant of a cluster as the SYS user. Create users A, B, and C, and grant all the users the `CREATE SESSION` privilege and user A the `GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE` privilege. 

   ```shell
   obclient > CREATE USER A IDENTIFIED BY **1***;
   obclient > CREATE USER B IDENTIFIED BY **1***;
   obclient > CREATE USER C IDENTIFIED BY **1***;
   obclient > GRANT CREATE SESSION TO A;
   obclient > GRANT CREATE SESSION TO B;
   obclient > GRANT CREATE SESSION TO C;
   obclient > GRANT GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE TO A;
   ```

2. Create a test table under the SYS user. 

   ```shell
   obclient > CREATE TABLE test (id number(10),name varchar2(10));
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.050 sec)
   ```

3. Grant user A the privilege to query the test table of the SYS user. 

   ```shell
   obclient > GRANT SELECT ON sys.test TO A;
   ```

4. Log on as user A and grant user B the privilege to query the test table using the `WITH GRANT OPTION` cause, so that user B can grant the same privilege to other users. 

   ```shell
   obclient > GRANT SELECT ON sys.test TO B with grant option;
   ```

5. Switch to user B and query the test table. 

   ```shell
   obclient > SELECT * FROM sys.test
   ```

6. Log on as user B and grant user C the privilege to query the test table. 

   ```shell
   obclient > GRANT SELECT ON sys.test TO C;
   ```

7. Switch to user C and query the test table. 

   ```shell
   obclient > SELECT * FROM sys.test;
   ```

If you grant the privilege to user A without using the `WITH GRANT OPTION` clause, the following error message is returned when user A attempts to grant the same privilege to user C:

```shell
obclient > GRANT SELECT on sys.test TO C ;
ORA-01031: insufficient privileges
```
