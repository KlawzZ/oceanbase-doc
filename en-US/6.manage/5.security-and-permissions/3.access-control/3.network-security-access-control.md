# Network security access control

OceanBase Database allows you to implement network access control based on whitelist strategies. You can use the tenant whitelist feature to allow only specific clients to access a tenant. 

The `ob_tcp_invited_nodes` parameter specifies the global whitelist for a tenant. The default value is `127.0.0.1,::1`, which indicates that the tenant is accessible only to the clients on the server where the tenant is hosted.
You can specify a list of values for the parameter and separate them with commas (,). For example, you can specify the values in A,B,C,D format. When a user logs on to an OBServer node, the OBServer node matches the IP address of the user against the four values. If the IP address of the user matches none of them, the access is denied. If the IP address of the user matches any one of them, access is allowed. 

You can specify the values in the following formats:

* A regular IP address such as `192.168.1.1`. Access is allowed only when the IP address of the client is identical to the specified value. 
* An IP address that contains percent signs (%) or underscores (_), such as `192.168.1.%` or `192.168.1._`. In this case, fuzzy matching is used, which is similar to the LIKE operator. 
* An IP address that contains netmasks such as `192.168.1.0/24` or `192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0`. In this case, mask matching is used. Access is allowed only when the Client_IP & netmask equals the specified value.

## View and set a tenant whitelist

1. Log on to the sys tenant of a cluster as the root user. 

   ```shell
   obclient -uroot@sys -P2881 -h10.xxx.xxx.1 -p*******
   ```

2. Execute the following statement to view the tenant whitelist: 

   ```shell
   obclient> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'ob_tcp_invited_nodes';
   +----------------------+-------+
   | Variable_name        | Value |
   +----------------------+-------+
   | ob_tcp_invited_nodes | %     |
   +----------------------+-------+
   ```

   A value of `%` indicates that the tenant is accessible to clients with any IP address. 

3. To modify the whitelist, execute the following statements: 

   Example:

   ```shell
   obclient> SET GLOBAL ob_tcp_invited_nodes='%';
   
   obclient> SET GLOBAL ob_tcp_invited_nodes='10.10.10.%';
   ```
