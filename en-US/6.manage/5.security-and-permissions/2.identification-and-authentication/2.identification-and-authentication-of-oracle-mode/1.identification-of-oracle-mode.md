# Identity authentication

The identity authentication feature validates the user identity when a user logs on to a database to access data, verifies whether the user can be associated with a database user, and implements security control on the activities of the user in the database based on the privileges of the associated database user. This topic describes identity authentication in Oracle mode.

   <h4>Applicability</h4>
   <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database in Oracle mode. OceanBase Database Community Edition supports only the MySQL mode. For more information about identity authentication in MySQL mode, see <a href="../1.security-permissions-mysql-mode/1.province-identification-of-mysql-mode.md">Identity authentication</a>. </p>

In Oracle mode, this feature authenticates the usernames and passwords of users to identify the users and the features and resources accessible to them. OceanBase Database requires all users to log on with the correct usernames and passwords to ensure database security. 

## Examples

In Oracle mode, users in a tenant must have unique usernames. However, users in different tenants can have the same usernames. Therefore, a user is globally identified by a username and a tenant name in the `username@tenant name` format. 

1. Log on to an Oracle tenant of a cluster as the SYS user. 

   ```shell
   obclient -usys@oracle -h10.xxx.xxx.1 - P2881 -P***1***
   ```

2. Execute the following statement to create a user named `u1`. 

   ```shell
   obclient> CREATE USER u1 IDENTIFIED BY **1***;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.064 sec)
   ```

3. Execute the following statement to grant user `u1` the privilege to connect to the database. 

   ```shell
   obclient>GRANT CREATE SESSION TO u1;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.045 sec)
   ```

4. Log on to the cluster as user `u1`. 

   ```shell
   $obclient -h10.xxx.xxx.1 -P2881 -uu1@oracle001 -p**1*** -A
