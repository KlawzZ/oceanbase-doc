# Password complexity

To prevent malicious password attacks, OceanBase Database allows you to set a password complexity function as needed to verify the logon identity and improve database security. This topic describes how to set password complexity for users who attempt to log on to OceanBase Database. 

## Related variables

In MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, you can specify password complexity rules by configuring a series of tenant-level system variables. When you create a user or when a user changes the logon password, the logon password is verified based on the configured system variables. If the password verification fails, an error is returned. The following table describes the relevant system variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Description |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| validate_password_check_user_name | Specifies whether the user password can be identical to the username.  | <ul><li>`on`: The user password cannot be identical to the username. </li><li>`off`: The user password can be identical to the username. Default value: `off`. </li></ul> |
| validate_password_length | The minimum length of the user password.  | Default value: 0.  |
| validate_password_mixed_case_count | The minimum number of letters that a user password must contain.  | Default value: 0.  |
| validate_password_number_count | The minimum number of digits that a user password must contain.  | Default value: 0.  |
| validate_password_policy | The password check strategy.  | <ul><li>`low`: specifies to check only the password length. </li><li>`medium`: specifies to check the password length, the number of uppercase letters, the number of lowercase letters, the number of digits, the number of special characters, and whether the password is identical to the username.  |
| validate_password_special_char_count | The minimum number of special characters that a user password must contain.  | Default value: 0.  |

## Set password complexity

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice:</h4>
    <p>In the production environment, we recommend that you set passwords to 20 characters in length, and the passwords must contain digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. Low-complexity passwords such as those containing a username or repeated characters are more likely to be cracked. Therefore, you must ensure the high complexity of passwords for security purposes. 
    </li></p>
  </main>

This section describes how to set the following password complexity rules: A password must be eight characters in length, including at least three uppercase letters, three lowercase letters, and one special character. A user password cannot be identical to the username, and the password check strategy must be `medium`. 

1. Log on to a MySQL tenant of a cluster as the root user. 

   ```shell
   obclient -uroot@mysql -P2881 -h10.xxx.xxx.1 -p*******
   ```

2. Specify system variables to set password complexity. 

   ```shell
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_check_user_name=off;
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_length=8;
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_mixed_case_count=3;
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_special_char_count=1;
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_policy='medium';
   ```

3. Log off and log on again to check whether the variable settings have taken effect. 

   ```shell
   obclient> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'validate%';
   +--------------------------------------+--------+
   +--------------------------------------+--------+
   | VARIABLE_NAME                        | VALUE  |
   +--------------------------------------+--------+
   | validate_password_check_user_name    | off     |
   | validate_password_length             | 8      |
   | validate_password_mixed_case_count   | 3      |
   | validate_password_number_count       | 0      |
   | validate_password_policy             | medium |
   | validate_password_special_char_count | 1      |
   +--------------------------------------+--------+
   6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
   ```

4. Verify password complexity. 

   Create two users. Set a valid password for one user and an invalid password for the other user. 

   ```shell
   obclient> CREATE USER sectest1 IDENTIFIED BY '***1**';
   ERROR 1819 (HY000): Your password does not satisfy the current policy
   requirements
   
   obclient> CREATE USER sectest1 IDENTIFIED BY '***1_%';
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

   The creation of the user with the invalid password fails.
