# Transmission encryption of OBServer nodes

The communication between OBServer nodes, liboblog, and ob_admin depends on the libeasy library. Therefore, they all support loading private keys and certificates from local files. CA certificates, user certificates, and private keys are stored in the `wallet/` directory and are loaded based on the configuration. This mode is not secure.

## Method

You can perform the following steps to enable transmission encryption for an OBServer node:

1. Log on to the sys tenant as the root user.

2. Specify the method for loading the private key, user certificate, or CA certificate.

   ```sql
   alter system set ssl_external_kms_info = '
   {
   "ssl_mode":"file"
   }';
   ```

3. Enable SSL on the MySQL port.

   By default, SSL is disabled on the MySQL port. You can modify the `ssl_client_authentication` parameter to enable SSL. The modification takes effect immediately.

   ```sql
   alter system set ssl_client_authentication = 'TRUE';
   SSL is enabled for MySQL communication when the parameter is set to TRUE.
   ```

4. Configure an SSL whitelist for RPC communication. TCP connections between OBServer nodes are persistent connections. To enable SSL-encrypted RPC communication, restart the OBServer nodes.

   ```sql
   A whitelist is required to enable SSL-encrypted RPC communication.
   alter system set _ob_ssl_invited_nodes='ALL'; Enable SSL for the entire cluster.
   alter system set _ob_ssl_invited_nodes='135.xxx.xx.xx, 128.xxx.xx.xx'; Enable SSL only for OBServer nodes with the specified IP addresses.
   ssl
   ```

## Check whether transmission encryption is enabled for an OBServer node

The most straightforward approach is to capture packets from the MySQL and RPC ports of the OBServer node to check whether the packets are encrypted. You can also use the following method:

* Use the system tenant account to log on to an OBServer node from OBClient or a MySQL client, and query the `ssl_cert_expired_time` field in the `oceanbase.GV$OB_SERVERS` view to check whether SSL is enabled.

* This field records the expiration time of the SSL certificate used by the current OBServer node when SSL is enabled. The time is displayed in UTC in microseconds.

   ```shell
   obclient> select svr_ip, svr_port,zone, ssl_cert_expired_time, from_unixtime(ssl_cert_expired_time/1000000) from oceanbase.GV$OB_SERVERS;
   +--------------+----------+-------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | svr_ip       | svr_port | zone  | ssl_cert_expired_time | from_unixtime(ssl_key_expired_time/1000000) |
   +--------------+----------+-------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | 100.xx.xx.xx |    13212 | zone1 |           1871860075 | 2029-04-26 09:07:55                         |
   +--------------+----------+-------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   1 row in set (0.00 sec)
   ```

### Check whether SSL is enabled on the MySQL port

Log on to an OBServer node from OBClient or a MySQL client and run the `\s` command to query the SSL field.

```shell
obclient> \s

### Check whether SSL is enabled on the RPC port

Open the `OBServer.log` file, search for "RPC connection accept", and then check the value of `use_ssl`. If the value is True, SSL is enabled for RPC communication. Otherwise, SSL is disabled.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>You must restart the cluster or disconnect the existing RPC connection for SSL to take effect. </p>
  </main>
