# Cancel recovery

You can cancel an ongoing recovery job of a tenant by deleting the tenant.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of a cluster as the `root` user.

2. Execute the following statement to delete the tenant for which data is to be recovered:

   ```sql
   obclient> DROP TENANT tenant_name FORCE;
   ```

   Set `tenant_name` to the name of the tenant for which data is to be recovered.
