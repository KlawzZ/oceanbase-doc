# Overview

This topic describes how a layered minor compaction works.

The storage engine of OceanBase Database uses the LSM-Tree architecture. In this architecture, data is divided into two parts: MemTables and SSTables. When the memory occupied by a MemTable reaches a specified threshold, data in the MemTable is flushed to the disk to free up the memory space. This process is called a minor compaction. Before the minor compaction, OceanBase Database freezes the active MemTable to prevent new data writes to it and creates a new one for data writes. This process is called a minor freeze.

## Layered minor compaction

In OceanBase Database V2.1.x and earlier, only one SSTable is maintained at a time during a minor compaction. When data in a MemTable is merged into the SSTable during each minor compaction, the size of the SSTable grows along with the number of minor compactions. In addition, the amount of data to be processed increases along with the number of minor compactions. As a result, the compaction speed decreases, and the memory of the MemTable is fully occupied. OceanBase Database introduces a layered minor compaction strategy since V2.2.x.

The following figure shows how a layered minor compaction works.

The process of a minor compaction in OceanBase Database is divided into the following layers:

* L0 layer

   The L0 layer consists of mini SSTables. However, the L0 layer may contain no mini SSTables based on minor compaction strategies specified by different parameters.

   OceanBase Database provides server-level parameters to specify the number of internal layers in the L0 layer and the maximum number of mini SSTables at each internal layer. The L0 layer is divided into several internal layers from `level-0` to `level-n`. Each internal layer contains the same maximum number of mini SSTables. If the number of mini SSTables at `level-n` of the L0 layer reaches the upper limit or the specified threshold, the mini SSTables merge into one SSTable that is written to the `level-n`+1 layer. If the number of mini SSTables at the top level of the L0 layer reaches the upper limit, the L0 layer is merged with the L1 layer to release the space. If the L0 layer is defined in a strategy, frozen MemTables are written to a new mini SSTable at level-0 of the L0 layer, and mini SSTables at each level of the L0 layer are sequenced by base_version. During an intra-layer or cross-layer compaction, all mini SSTables that participate in the compaction are merged in sequence. In this way, the version-based sequence is maintained among the newly merged mini SSTables. This simplifies the logic to read the merged SSTables later.

   Layering of the L0 layer delays the compaction to the L1 layer and reduces write amplification. However, layering introduces read amplification. If the L0 layer has n internal layers and each layer has at most m mini SSTables, the L0 layer may contain up to `(n Ã— m + 2)` mini SSTables. Therefore, you must properly specify the number of layers and the upper limit of mini SSTables at each layer.

* L1 layer

   The L1 layer consists of minor SSTables that are sequenced by the rowkey. If the number of mini SSTables at the L0 layer reaches the major compaction threshold, they are merged into minor SSTables at the L1 layer. To increase the merge efficiency and reduce write amplification, OceanBase Database allows you to set a write amplification factor. Merge with the minor SSTables at the L1 layer is scheduled only when the ratio of the total size of mini SSTables at the L0 layer to that of minor SSTables at the L1 layer reaches the specified threshold.

* L2 layer

   The L2 layer consists of baseline major SSTables. To ensure that the baseline data is completely consistent across replicas, the major SSTables are read-only in minor compactions.

## Trigger a minor compaction

A minor compaction can be automatically or manually triggered.
