# Delete an ODP cluster

You can delete an ODP cluster that is no longer required. After an ODP cluster is deleted, the OBProxies in the cluster are uninstalled from all hosts, and the resources occupied by ODP services on the hosts are released.

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console and are assigned the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.

* The ODP cluster to be deleted no longer provides the proxy service.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the ODP cluster list, click the ODP cluster that you want to refresh to go to the **Overview** page of the ODP cluster.

4. Click **Delete Cluster**.
