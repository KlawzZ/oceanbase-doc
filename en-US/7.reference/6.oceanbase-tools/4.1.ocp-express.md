# OCP Express

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Express is a web-based management tool for OceanBase Database V4.x. It is integrated into the OceanBase cluster and allows you to view key performance metrics and perform basic database management operations on the database cluster. OCP Express is derived from OCP. It retains the core capabilities of OCP and adjusts the overall layout of features to provide a brand-new user experience. It also adjusts feature configurations so that it can be deployed on any database node with ultralow resource consumption. With OCP Express, you can obtain extensive management experience of OceanBase Database V4.x at minimum cost.

## Features

OCP Express supports the following five cluster management features:

* Cluster overview: allows you to view core information such as the topology, status information, resource consumption, and slow SQL statements of the cluster.
* Tenant management: allows you to manage tenants in the cluster, such as tenant creation, tenant deletion, database management, and parameter management.
* Monitoring center: provides monitoring data at the cluster and tenant levels and covers a wide range of monitoring metrics such as performance monitoring and host monitoring.
* Diagnostics center: allows you to effectively manage tenant sessions and slow SQL statements, such as closing sessions and enabling SQL throttling.
* Log service: allows you to analyze related logs of the OBServer, OCP-Agent, and host to facilitate troubleshooting.

## Architecture

OCP Express adopts the **Agent-Server** architecture with the following characteristics:

* The OCP Express server can be deployed on any OBServer node or another node.
* The OCP-Agent service is deployed on each OBServer node for interacting with the OCP server and executing the O&M operations sent by the OCP server.
* The metadata and monitoring data of OCP Express are stored in a separate tenant in the database cluster. In this way, the tenant that stores the data of OCP Express is isolated from business tenants, and no additional cluster is needed to store the data of OCP Express.
* One OCP Express manages only one OceanBase cluster, which simplifies the logic and enhances capabilities.

## Installation and deployment

OCP Express is integrated into the OceanBase cluster. You can download the all-in-one package of OceanBase Database and select OCP Express during deployment.

* Obtain the all-in-one packages of OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition and OceanBase Database Community Edition in [OceanBase Download Center](https://www.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter).
* For more information about [Deploy OCP Express by using commands](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-cn-10000000001690027), and [Deploy an OceanBase cluster on the GUI](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-cn-10000000001690695).

### Configuration requirements

OCP Express will generate high computing and storage overheads during running. Therefore, you must plan resources based on the scale of the managed object.

The following table lists the resource overheads of the OCP Express server on the premises that each cluster contains 10 tenants. You can calculate the required resources based on your business requirements.

| Number of servers to be managed | CPU (core) | Memory (GB) | Disk (GB) |
|---|----|---|---|
| ≤ 10 | 1 | 2 | 20 |
| ≤ 20 | 2 | 4 | 20 |
| ≤ 50 | 4 | 8 | 20 |

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Plan the resource configurations of the OCP Express server based on the preceding overhead data and the consumption of other resources in the system. For system stability purposes, we recommend that at least four CPU cores and 8 GB of memory are configured for the OCP Express server. When a single host runs 10 tenants or less, we still recommend that four CPU cores and 8 GB of memory are configured for the OCP Express server. </p>

### MetaDB resources

MetaDB stores the metadata and monitoring data of OCP Express. We recommend that you create a separate tenant for MetaDB in your OceanBase cluster.

The following table lists the CPU, memory, and disk resources for each replica of the MetaDB tenant on the premises that each cluster contains 10 tenants. You can calculate the required resources based on your business requirements.

| Number of servers to be managed | CPU (core) | Memory (GB) | Disk (GB) |
|---|----|---|---|
| ≤ 10 | 1 | 4 | 50 |
| ≤ 20 | 2 | 8 | 100 |
| ≤ 50 | 4 | 16 | 200 |

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>The preceding resource requirements are for reference only. The actual amount of resources varies with the business transactions. </p>

## FAQ

* What are the differences between OCP Express and OCP?

   OCP Express is intended for lightweight O&M management and is integrated into the managed OceanBase cluster for dedicated management. It helps minimize resource consumption while meeting basic O&M management requirements. OCP is oriented for the O&M of large-scale complex clusters. One OCP can manage multiple OceanBase clusters. OCP provides more management capabilities. An additional OceanBase cluster is needed to store the data of OCP, and higher resource configurations are needed to implement the capabilities of OCP.

* Can OCP Express be separately deployed?

   At present, OCP Express must be installed and deployed by using the all-in-one package of OceanBase Database. After deployment, you can directly use OCP Express to manage your OceanBase cluster without configuration.

* What are the application scenarios of OCP Express?

   OCP Express is applicable to the O&M management of an OceanBase cluster in a test environment or a small- or medium-scale production environment with no more than 20 hosts and 3 to 5 tenants.
