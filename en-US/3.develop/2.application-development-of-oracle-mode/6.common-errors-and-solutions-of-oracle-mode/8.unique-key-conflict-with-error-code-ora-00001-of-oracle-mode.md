# Duplicate data inserted, with ORA-00001 error reported

This topic describes how to handle the `ORA-00001` error, where duplicate data is entered during data insertion to OceanBase Database in Oracle mode. 

## Symptom

When you insert data into the `t_insert` table with primary keys, this error is returned, indicating that the primary key values in the inserted data are duplicate with the existing primary key values. 

```sql
obclient [SYS]> INSERT INTO t_insert(id, name, value) VALUES (3,'US', 10003),(4, 'JP', 10004);
ORA-00001: unique constraint '3' for key 'PRIMARY' violated
```

The error codes corresponding to this error message are as follows:

* Error code: ORA-00001

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5024

* SQLSTATE: 23000

For more information about the error codes, see [Overview](../../../7.reference/5.system-reference/7.error-code-of-oracle-mode/1.use-error-information-of-oracle-mode.md). 

## Possible causes

When you insert data into a table with a UNIQUE constraint, the system reports an error when the inserted data is duplicate with an existing record. 

## Troubleshooting procedure

You can take either of the following two methods to solve the conflict. 

1. Query data in the `t_insert` table to confirm whether the inserted data is duplicate with data in the primary key column and determine whether to retain or change the data in the existing rows. 

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
   +----+------+-------+
   | ID | NAME | VALUE |
   +----+------+-------+
   |  1 | CN   | 10001 |
   |  2 | EN   | 10002 |
   |  3 | UK   | 10003 |
   |  4 | JP   | 10004 |
   +----+------+-------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

2. To retain existing rows, you can execute the following statement to update the record whose `id` value is 3.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> UPDATE t_insert SET name = 'US' WHERE id = 3;
   Query OK, 1 row affected
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > * You can also use the `MERGE INTO` statement to avoid unique key conflicts. For more information, see [Replace data](../../1.application-development-of-mysql-mode/3.write-data-of-mysql-mode/4.replace-data.md). 
   > * If you confirm that the existing row is not needed, you can delete it. For more information, see [Delete data](../../1.application-development-of-mysql-mode/3.write-data-of-mysql-mode/3.delete-data.md). 

3. After successful deletion, view the data in the `t_insert` table again. 

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]>  SELECT * FROM t_insert;
   +----+------+-------+
   | ID | NAME | VALUE |
   +----+------+-------+
   |  1 | CN   | 10001 |
   |  2 | EN   | 10002 |
   |  3 | US   | 10003 |
   |  4 | JP   | 10004 |
   +----+------+-------+
   4 rows in set
   ```
