# About queries

A query is a SELECT statement that retrieves data from one or more tables or views. 

Syntax for the simplest SQL query statement:

```javascript
SELECT select_list FROM table_list;
```

* In the syntax, `select_list` specifies the columns, functions, constants, or variables from `table_list`. 

* Constants, or variables from the `table_list` variable that follows. 

* `table_list` specifies the tables or views that contain the data to be selected. 

The preceding example is a simple SQL query statement. `table_list` can also be a subquery. You can add a WHERE clause to filter results returned by the query. 

Note that in an Oracle tenant, `table_list` can be replaced with a DUAL table, which is a dummy table. In this case, `select_list` does not specify a specific column. Instead, it is a constant or variable. See the following example SQL statement:

```javascript
$obclient -h10.0.0.0 -utpcc@t_oracle0_91#obdoc -P2883 -p**1*** tpcc
obclient> select 'Medium', 6*6 from dual;
+-------+-----+
| 'Medium'  | 6*6 |
+-------+-----+
| Medium    |  36 |
+-------+-----+
1 row in set
```
