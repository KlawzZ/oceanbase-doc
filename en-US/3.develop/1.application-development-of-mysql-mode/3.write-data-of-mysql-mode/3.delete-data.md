# Delete data

After you insert data into a table, you can use the `DELETE` statement or other statements to delete records from the table. This topic describes how to delete data from a table by using statements. 

## Preparations

Before you delete data from a table, make sure that:

* You have logged on to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database. For more information about how to connect to OceanBase Database, see [Overview](../../1.application-development-based-on-mysql-mode/1.database-connection/1.connection-mode-overview.md). 

   > **Note**
   >
   > You can query the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS` view in the `sys` tenant to confirm the mode of the tenant to which you have logged on. 

* You have the `DELETE` privilege on the target table. To use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement to clear the data in a table, you must also have the `CREATE` privilege on this table. For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](7.reference\3.user-guide-old\6.basic-database-management\4.manage-tenants-1\5.manage-users-and-permissions\3.mysql-3\4.view-user-permissions-1.md). If you do not have the required privileges, contact the administrator. For more information, see [Modify user privileges](7.reference\3.user-guide-old\6.basic-database-management\4.manage-tenants-1\5.manage-users-and-permissions\3.mysql-3\5.modify-user-permissions-2.md). 

## Use the DELETE statement to delete data

Generally, the [DELETE](../../../7.reference/6.sql-syntax/2.common-tenant-mysql-mode/6.sql-statement/21.DELETE.md) statement is used to delete all data or part of the data from a table. 

> **Note**
>
> Besides the `DELETE` statement, you can also use the `REPLACE INTO` statement to delete data. For more information about the `REPLACE INTO` statement, see [Replace data](4.replace-data.md). 

Syntax:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name [ WHERE condition ];
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| table_name | Yes | The table from which data is to be deleted.  |
| [WHERE condition] | No | The condition for deleting data. If no condition is specified, all data in the table is deleted.  |

### Delete part of the data

You can use the `DELETE` statement with a `WHERE` condition to delete the data that meets the condition from a table. 

Example: Delete all rows that meet the `value = 10004` condition from the `t_insert` table.

```sql
obclient [test]> DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value = 10004;
Query OK, 1 row affected
```

### Delete all data

If a table contains a small amount of data, you can directly use the `DELETE` statement to delete all rows. 

Example:

* Delete all rows from the `t_insert` table. 

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> DELETE FROM t_insert;
   Query OK, 3 row affected
   ```

   For a table that contains millions of records, deleting all the records at a time may result in performance issues. We recommend that you delete the data in batches by using the `WHERE` condition, or [use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement to empty a table](# Use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement to empty a table). 

* Filter the data in the `value` column of the `t_insert` table. Execute multiple statements to respectively delete the data that meets the `value < 10000`, `value < 20000`, and `value < 30000` conditions in batches. 

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value < 100000;

   obclient [test]> DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value < 200000;

   obclient [test]> DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value < 300000;
   ```

## Use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement to empty a table

The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement clears a table but retains its schema, including the partitions defined for the table. Logically, this statement is equivalent to the `DELETE FROM` statement that is used to delete all rows. 

Syntax:

```sql
TRUNCATE [TABLE] table_name;
```

Example: Use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement to empty the `t_insert` table.

```sql
obclient [test]> TRUNCATE TABLE t_insert;
```

For more information about the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement, see [TRUNCATE TABLE](../../../7.reference/4.development-guide-refactoring/1.sql-syntax/2.common-tenant-mysql-mode/6.sql-statement/59.truncate-table.md).
